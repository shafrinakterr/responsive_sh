                    <p>We have all been on vacation with a significant other and found ourselves staring out the hotel
                        window at a championship golf course with no plans to play. Bummer. But not with Foresome. While
                        your loved one hits the spa, you can hit the links by matching yourself with compatible golf
                        partners so that you can make the most out of your vacation. Find your ideal foursome or partner
                        with a similar handicap, gambling companion, or drinking buddy using our proprietary algorithm.

                        held at a GOLF RESORT. But you never have to worry about that when you have Foresome. Instead of
                        playing alone or risking getting paired with two slow pokes who can’t stop talking about their
                        RV, you can use the app to find your ideal golf partners and make the most of your afternoon
                        off. Stop wishing you had someone to play with and actually find someone to play with on
                        Foresome.</p> <br>
                    <p class="margin_bottom">Let those other apps worry about finding you a life partner. Foresome will find you the perfect
